# Individual Modules
In the each section, an individual module is explored with its important logic explained.
The section title matches the module name in the rocket-core source code, and if the module is an acronym, it is expanded.

<div class="warning">
Each section is named according to the Chisel module, <em>not</em> the file that contains the module!
This is because Chisel allows you to have multiple modules in the same source file, which may do wildly different things (though this is a higly-discouraged practice).
This also means we can skip describing helper modules/bundles if they are fairly straight-forward.
